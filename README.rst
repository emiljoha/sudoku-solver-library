Description
-----------

This is my Sudoku solver. There are many like
it, but this one is mine. Got frustrated with my inability to solve
them. So i made a way to solve them, all of them, *evil laugh*. Now no
sudoku scares me anymore.

The result is this open source sudoku solver written in c++. Have
solved any sudoku i have tried so far, for easy sodokus in less than a
second and harder sudokus a few seconds. A brief summary of the
different steps in the algorithm is summarized as comments to
functions in the header file. Imports sodokus as matrixes with zeros
for blanks, can test if inserted sodoku breakes the rules of sudoku
puzzels and solves the sodoku.

Compilation
-----------

Run make to compile the library to a object file .o and static library
file .a

Usage
-----
